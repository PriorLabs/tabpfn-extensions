# AutoGluon TabPFN Wrapper

This project is a lightweight wrapper that integrates **TabPFN (Tabular PFN v2)** into **AutoGluon Tabular**, enabling you to use TabPFN as part of AutoGluon's AutoML pipeline. It provides a scikit-learn compatible interface and leverages AutoGluonâ€™s capabilities like automatic feature engineering, ensemble training, and resource management.

## Requirements

To use this AutoGluon TabPFN wrapper, you need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install "autogluon.tabular" "ray>=2.10.0,<2.45.0"
```


# TODOs: 
- More epxlcit configs for Autogluon parameters that we deem important
- Work on TODOs + FIXMEs in Code
- More flexible config so that we not just construct TabPFN esnembles, but mix different models 
- Integrate TabPFN Time-Series
