# AutoGluon TabPFN Wrapper

This project is a lightweight wrapper that integrates **TabPFN (Tabular PFN v2)** into **AutoGluon Tabular**, enabling you to use TabPFN as part of AutoGluon's AutoML pipeline. It provides a scikit-learn compatible interface and leverages AutoGluon’s capabilities like automatic feature engineering, ensemble training, and resource management.

## Requirements

To use this AutoGluon TabPFN wrapper, you need the following Python packages:

- `autogluon.tabular`
- `tabpfn_extensions` (which likely includes `tabpfn` as a dependency)
- `ray>=2.10.0,<2.45.0` (for AutoGluon's parallel processing)
- `scipy`


# TODOs: 
- More epxlcit configs for Autogluon parameters that we deem important
- Work on TODOs + FIXMEs in Code
- More flexible config so that we not just construct TabPFN esnembles, but mix different models 
- Integrate TabPFN Time-Series
